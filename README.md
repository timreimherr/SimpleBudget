# SimpleBudget
A personal budget web application enabling the user to allocate funds into categories and then record spending based on those categories. The plan is to start with a web application and then to build a mobile app based on it. 

I'm using Entity Framework code first for the data layer and Bootstrap with jQuery for the UI. 

It is a work in progress.
